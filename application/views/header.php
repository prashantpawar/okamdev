  This xhtml document is marked up to provide the designer with the maximum possible flexibility.
  There are more classes and extraneous tags than needed, and in a real world situation, it's more
  likely that it would be much leaner.
  
  However, I think we can all agree that even given that, we're still better off than if this had been
  built with tables.
